## Market Basket Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the Market Basket Analysis Dashboard repository! This project provides an end-to-end solution for performing market basket analysis using association rule mining on retail transaction data. Our solution includes a machine learning pipeline to extract association rules from transaction data and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to explore and visualize the results.

## Overview

**Product Description:**  
This project uses real-world retail data (e.g., the Online Retail dataset) to discover patterns and associations between items purchased together. By applying techniques such as the Apriori algorithm, we extract frequent itemsets and generate association rules. These rules help retailers understand customer buying behavior and identify opportunities for cross-selling, promotions, and inventory management.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and transforms raw transaction data into a one-hot encoded basket suitable for market basket analysis.
- **Association Rule Mining:** Utilizes the Apriori algorithm to generate frequent itemsets and derive association rules based on metrics such as support, confidence, and lift.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built using Streamlit, the dashboard allows users to explore the association rules interactively with filtering options and dynamic visualizations.
- **Scalability:** The pipeline is designed with modular components, enabling easy extension and integration with larger datasets and more advanced models.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/MarketBasketAnalysis.git
   cd MarketBasketAnalysis

## Setup a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
# Usage

## Data Preprocessing & Model Pipeline

### Run the Data Preprocessing Script

Navigate to the `src/data_preprocessing/` folder and execute the preprocessing script to clean and transform the raw dataset:

```bash
python load_data.py
```

# Generate Association Rules

Next, run the market basket analysis pipeline (e.g., `apriori.py`) located in the `src/models/` folder:

 ```bash
 python apriori.py
```
# Front-End Dashboard
Run the Streamlit Application
Navigate to the frontend/ folder and run the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
# Explore the Dashboard
The dashboard offers interactive filtering (e.g., adjusting the lift threshold) and displays the association rules in a user-friendly interface.

# Methodology
## Data Loading & Cleaning
We load the raw dataset from Excel using pandas (with openpyxl).
* Handle missing values.
* Filter invalid transactions.
* Convert data types as needed.

## Feature Engineering
*The cleaned data is pivoted to create a transactional basket.
*One-hot encoding is applied so that each transaction is represented as a binary vector indicating the presence of items.

# Future Scalability
## Algorithm Optimization
* Further tuning of support, confidence, and lift thresholds can improve the quality of the extracted rules.
Alternative algorithms like FP-Growth can be considered for performance improvements.
## Data Integration
* Integrate larger and more diverse datasets, including real-time streaming data, to enhance the model's applicability in dynamic retail environments.
## Enhanced Visualization
* Extend the dashboard with advanced visualizations, such as network graphs and interactive charts, to provide deeper insights.
## Modular Architecture
* The project is built with a modular structure, making it easier to integrate new features, such as recommendation systems or predictive analytics, in the future.
## Deployment
* Consider deploying the dashboard on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, or Streamlit Sharing) for wider accessibility and real-time analytics.
